PVTM-Enron_report: Topic detection results reported from using PVTM (Paragraph Vector Topic Model) on a relevant subset of Enron data. 

LDA-PVTM-Enron_report: Compares the performance of topic models PVTM and LDA on the test documents from a relevant subset of Enron data, suggesting a combination of PVTM + LDA models for better topic detections.
