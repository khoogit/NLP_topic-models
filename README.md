Topic models:

a. LDA-Enron_report: A detailed description of a series of experiments and their corresponding results, done using the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model on Enron dataset, with a focus on a relevant subset of the data.

b. PVTM-Enron_report: Topic detection results reported from using PVTM (Paragraph Vector Topic Model) on a relevant subset of Enron data. 

c. LDA-PVTM-Enron_report: Compares the performance of topic models PVTM and LDA on the test documents from a relevant subset of Enron data, suggesting a combination of PVTM + LDA models for better topic detections.

Text generation:

GPT2-EarthScience_report: A description of experiments and their corresponding results from text generation using GPT2 fine-tuned on Earth Science dataset (on natural phenomena) provided by NASA. Complementary findings to an Earth Science challenge ("Automated Reporting of Natural Events Using Satellite Imagery and Metadata") from NASA Frontier Development Lab 2021.
