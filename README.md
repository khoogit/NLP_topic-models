NLP topic models:

a. LDA-Enron_report: A detailed description of a series of experiments and their corresponding results, done using the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model on Enron dataset, with a focus on a relevant subset of the data.

b. PVTM-Enron_report: Topic detection results reported from using PVTM (Paragraph Vector Topic Model) on a relevant subset of Enron data. 

c. LDA-PVTM-Enron_report: Compares the performance of topic models PVTM and LDA on the test documents from a relevant subset of Enron data, suggesting a combination of PVTM + LDA models for better topic detections.
